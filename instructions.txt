Senior Data Science Technical Challenge
Climate Risk Chatbot
Background
Helios AI is an intelligence platform built to help global supply chain stakeholders anticipate and
respond to climate-related disruptions. We focus especially on commodity crop risk, combining
satellite data, climate forecasts, historical trends, and proprietary models to deliver early
warnings and strategic insights.
Our platform serves traders, agribusinesses, and governments who rely on timely, data-driven
decisions about crop yield, climate volatility, and global production. We use machine learning
and geospatial analytics to forecast everything from droughts in Brazil to flood risks in Southeast
Asia — and how those risks impact food security and pricing.
This challenge is based on a real section of our product — the Commodity Climate Risk
dashboard — where we synthesize climate volatility, seasonality, and regional crop exposure
into interactive visual summaries.
Objective
Create a chatbot agent using Crew AI that can answer a fixed set of 10 predefined user
questions based on data from our Commodity Climate Risk page (screenshot below).
Your chatbot should:
○ Parse the provided climate risk data via API (endpoints listed below).

● Use Crew AI to build AI agent teams that work together to answer user questions
accurately and contextually.
● Provide answers in natural language. Bonus if they can produce graphs and charts!
● Be containerized or scriptable so it’s easy for us to run and test.
Task Details
1. Chatbot Functionality
● Build a Crew AI agent or Crew that uses tools or memory to ingest our API data.
● Your agent should be able to answer 10 prewritten questions (see example set below).
● Assume a single dataset or set of endpoints covering: historical climate risk, current
season data, per-country summaries, etc.
2. Example Questions
You may adjust these or come up with similar ones:
1. What country has the highest current climate risk?
2. How does Brazil’s 2025 climate risk compare to its 10-year average?
3. What year was most similar to this season in terms of climate risk?
4. What’s the global average climate risk forecast for September 2025?
5. How does the EU’s risk today compare with last year?
6. What are the top 3 countries with the lowest historical risk?
7. What’s the trend in maximum climate risk from 2016 to 2025?
8. Did India’s risk increase or decrease from the previous growing season?
9. What is the current yield rating and how does it relate to risk?
10. Which regions are showing a spike in upcoming seasonal risk?
We'll be testing how well your bot handles these questions directly via terminal or API calls.
3. Submission Requirements
● Create a private GitHub repo and invite the following reviewers (e@helios.sc,
chhayly.sreng@helios.sc , nathan.longoni@helios.sc ).
● Include:
○ Crew AI logic / script
○ A document with the bots answers to all the questions as well as the QAed result
(always verify for response accuracy!)
○ requirements.txt or pyproject.toml
○ One PR submission for a small self-made “bug fix” or “feature” — just to show
you understand Git hygiene
○ README.md with:
■ Setup instructions
■ Explanation of your approach
■ How you would expand the bot to handle more dynamic or conversational
queries
● Preferably Dockerized or easily run via main.py
Timeline
● You’ll have 7 days to complete the challenge once we send the API endpoints.
● Need more time? Just let us know in advance.
Evaluation Criteria
● Functionality: Answers are accurate, relevant, and formatted clearly.
● Engineering: Clean, modular code structure.
● Git practices: Repo hygiene and quality of your pull request.
● Thoughtfulness: README and code comments help us understand your reasoning.
● Bonus: Use of tools, memory, or retrieval plugins inside Crew AI to optimize bot
performance.
