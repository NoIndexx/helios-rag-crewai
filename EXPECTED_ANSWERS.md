## Testing Instructions

To verify the LLM is working correctly:

1. **Run the comprehensive test**:
   ```bash
   python test_fix.py
   ```

2. **Check for these success criteria**:
   - âœ… **Tool Usage**: Each question should use the correct tool
   - âœ… **Content Accuracy**: Answers should contain expected keywords and data
   - âœ… **No Hallucination**: All data should come from actual API calls, not LLM knowledge

3. **Expected Success Rate**: 100% (10/10 tests passing)

## Debugging Failed Tests

If tests fail, check the logs for:
- `ðŸ”§ TOOL CALLED:` messages showing tool invocation
- Parameter passing (especially `commodity` parameter)
- API response data vs LLM output
- Query metadata in the UI showing correct tool and endpoint

## API Data Verification

The test suite is based on actual API responses verified on [timestamp]. If database content changes, update the expected keywords in `test_fix.py` accordingly.
