## Testing Instructions

To verify the LLM is working correctly:

1. **Run the comprehensive test**:
   ```bash
   python test_fix.py
   ```

2. **Check for these success criteria**:
   - âœ… **Tool Usage**: Each question should use the correct tool
   - âœ… **Content Accuracy**: Answers should contain expected keywords and data
   - âœ… **No Hallucination**: All data should come from actual API calls, not LLM knowledge

3. **Expected Success Rate**: 100% (10/10 tests passing)

## Debugging Failed Tests

If tests fail, check the logs for:
- `ðŸ”§ TOOL CALLED:` messages showing tool invocation
- Parameter passing (especially `commodity` parameter)
- API response data vs LLM output
- Query metadata in the UI showing correct tool and endpoint

## API Data Verification

The test suite is based on actual API responses verified through direct database queries. **Data verified: December 2024**

### Database Statistics:
- **Commodities**: 8 total (`Cocoa beans`, `Coffee, green`, `Corn: Commodity Tracked`, `Oil palm fruit`, `Rice`, `Soya beans`, `Sugar cane`, `Wheat`)
- **Records**: 
  - climate_risk_by_country: 1,170 records
  - risk_compared_hist_box: 390 records  
  - risk_global_avg_max: 1,000 records
  - most_similar_year: 39 records

### Key Verified Values:
- **Highest Risk**: India (IN) with 45.7 WAPR for Cocoa beans âœ…
- **Brazil 2025**: 16.6 WAPR vs 14.2 historical (16.9% increase) âœ…  
- **Similar Year**: 2018 most similar to 2025 growing season âœ…
- **Lowest Risk Countries**: Peru (13.4), Brazil (14.2), Ecuador (14.8) âœ…
- **EU Wheat**: Unchanged at 23.5 WAPR between 2025-2026 âœ…

If database content changes, update the expected keywords in `test_fix.py` accordingly.
